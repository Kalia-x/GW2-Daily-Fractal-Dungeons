The R script reads from the GW2 api, and records the names of the two fractals required for the day's "recommended daily fractal" achievements. It outputs these names into the  .csv file called "fractal_data.csv". The "fractalnames.txt" files is read from by the script, in order to convert the api codes into readable fractal names.
